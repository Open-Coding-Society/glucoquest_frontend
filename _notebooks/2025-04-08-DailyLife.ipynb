    "# Glucose Hero : A Day-in-the-Life Simulation Game\n",
    "\n",
    "An interactive simulation game where players experience a full day living with diabetes by making lifestyle choices (e.g., meals, activities, sleep). A virtual Dexcom CGM meter shows glucose level changes based on the player's decisions. Pop-up alerts and tips mimic real Dexcom device behavior to reinforce learning and drive awareness of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).\n",
