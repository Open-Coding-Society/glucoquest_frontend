    "![diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/aws_blog_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backend\n",
    "- Our backend is **Flask-based**, running on port **8520** for API requests.\n",
    "- It processes event data, manages user profiles, and handles notifications.\n",
    "- All API routes are managed in `main.py`, with separate modules for each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frontend\n",
    "- The frontend runs on port **4887**, communicating with the backend via **RESTful APIs**.\n",
    "- It fetches and updates data dynamically, enhancing user experience.\n",
    "- The frontend sends API requests to the backend, which interacts with the database and returns data.\n",
    "- The user interface updates accordingly based on API responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Features Working with Frontend to Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "### Racing Car Game with Leaderboard\n",
    "- **Backend:** Manages game sessions, scores, and leaderboard data via `/api/scores`.\n",
    "- **Frontend:** Runs the racing game, submits scores, and displays the top 10 players on the leaderboard.\n",
    "- **Database:** Stores player profiles, game scores, and ranking info.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perfect Plate Game with Leaderboard\n",
    "- **Backend:** Handles game logic, user attempts, and leaderboard updates at `/api/scores`.\n",
    "- **Frontend:** Lets users build their “perfect plate,” submits results, and shows the top 10 players.\n",
    "- **Database:** Saves user game results and leaderboard standings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Food Log with Glycemic Index Calculation\n",
    "- **Backend:** Accepts food entries, calculates glycemic index impact at `/api/food_log`.\n",
    "- **Frontend:** Allows users to log foods eaten, displays glycemic index info and daily summaries.\n",
    "- **Database:** Stores user food logs, glycemic index values, and nutritional info.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pin the Dexcom Game\n",
    "- **Backend:** Tracks user placements of the Dexcom CGM and stores glucose data throughout the day at `/api/pin_dexcom`.\n",
    "- **Frontend:** Provides an interactive “Pin the Dexcom” game for CGM placement practice and displays glucose trends over time.\n",
    "- **Database:** Saves user pin attempts and glucose readings for progress tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## **Deployment Process on AWS**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites  \n",
    "- Ensure the frontend and backend are properly connected and tested locally.  \n",
    "- Prepare the necessary configuration files, including `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `nginx` settings.  \n",
    "- Set up a DNS subdomain using AWS Route 53.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Initial Deployment Steps**\n",
    "1. Clone the repository:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   git clone <repo-url>\n",
    "   cd <project-directory>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a `.env` file inside the backend project folder and add necessary environment variables (such as passwords).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Initialize the database:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   ./scripts/db_init.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Build and deploy using Docker:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   docker-compose build\n",
    "   docker-compose up -d\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Verify the running container:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   docker ps\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Test the server:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   curl localhost:8206  # Ensure the port matches your updated backend port\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Port Selection & Docker Setup**  \n",
    "- Choose a backend port (`8520`) and ensure consistency across all configuration files.  \n",
    "- Update `main.py`, `Dockerfile`, and `docker-compose.yml` to use the correct port.  \n",
    "- Test the Docker container locally using `docker-compose up`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **AWS EC2 Access & Deployment**  \n",
    "- Log in to AWS EC2 and clone the backend repository.  \n",
    "- Build and deploy the backend using:\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  docker-compose up -d --build\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **DNS & Nginx Setup**\n",
    "- Configure a subdomain via AWS Route 53.\n",
    "- Set up an Nginx reverse proxy to route requests to the backend.\n",
    "- Activate and validate the Nginx configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **SSL & HTTPS Configuration**\n",
    "- Use Certbot to obtain an SSL certificate for HTTPS.\n",
    "- Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS for secure access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Maintaining Deployment**\n",
    "- Before making changes, pull the latest code from GitHub.\n",
    "- Test changes locally before pushing updates.\n",
    "- Restart the deployment on AWS by pulling changes and rebuilding the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## **Scalability, Security, and Reliability**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scalability: Handling Multiple Users Efficiently**  \n",
    "- **Gunicorn with Multiple Workers:** Ensures efficient request handling.  \n",
    "- **Dockerized Deployment:** Allows easy scaling by running multiple containers.  \n",
    "- **AWS Load Balancer (Future Consideration):** Can distribute traffic if scaling beyond one instance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Security: Protecting Data and Access**  \n",
    "- **Firewall & Security Groups:** Restrict unauthorized access to the backend.  \n",
    "- **JWT Authentication:** Ensures secure API access.  \n",
    "- **Nginx as Reverse Proxy:** Adds an extra security layer by handling incoming requests.  \n",
    "- **SSL/TLS Encryption (Certbot):** Enables HTTPS for secure data transmission.  \n",
    "- **Docker Isolation:** Runs services in containers to minimize security risks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reliability: Keeping the App Running Smoothly**  \n",
    "- **AWS CloudWatch Logs (Future Consideration):** Can be used for monitoring errors.  \n",
    "- **Nginx Error Handling:** Manages failures with proper routing.  \n",
    "- **Automatic Container Restarts:** Ensures uptime if a service crashes.  \n",
    "- **Daily Backups (To Be Implemented):** Helps prevent data loss.  \n",
