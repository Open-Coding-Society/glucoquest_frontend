# GlucoQuest

**GlucoQuest** is an interactive web application designed to educate users about diabetes and blood glucose management through games, quizzes, and engaging visual content. Developed by students in collaboration with Dexcom and PilotCity, this platform merges health awareness with gamified learning.

Our project supports students in software engineering and computer science education by providing hands-on experience with frontend development, backend APIs, GitHub Pages, and collaborative development workflows.
